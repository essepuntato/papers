            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p><em>Purpose:</em> this paper introduces the <em>Research Articles in Simplified
                    HTML</em> (or <em>RASH</em>), which is a Web-first format for writing HTML-based
                scholarly papers; it is accompanied by the <em>RASH Framework</em>, a set of tools
                for interacting with RASH-based articles. The paper also presents an evaluation that
                involved authors and reviewers of RASH articles submitted to the <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2015/index.html">SAVE-SD 2015</a> and <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2015/index.html">SAVE-SD 2016</a>
                workshops.</p>
            <p><em>Design:</em> RASH has been developed aiming to: be easy to learn and use; share
                scholarly documents (and embedded semantic annotations) through the Web; support its
                adoption within the existing publishing workflow </p>
            <p><em>Findings</em>: the evaluation study confirmed that RASH is ready to be be adopted in
                workshops, conferences, and journals and can be quickly learnt by researchers who are
                familiar with HTML.</p>
            <p><em>Research limitations:</em> the evaluation study also highlighted some issues in
                the adoption of RASH, and in general of HTML formats, especially by less technically 
                savvy users. Moreover, additional tools are needed, e.g. for enabling additional
                conversions from/to existing formats such as OpenXML.</p>
            <p><em>Practical implications:</em> RASH (and its Framework) is another step towards
                enabling the definition of formal representations of the meaning of the content of
                an article, facilitating its automatic discovery, enabling its linking to semantically
                related articles, providing access to data within the article in actionable form, and
                allowing integration of data between papers.</p>
            <p><em>Social implications:</em> RASH addresses the intrinsic needs related to the
                various users of a scholarly article: researchers (focussing on its content),
                readers (experiencing new ways for browsing it), citizen scientists (reusing
                available data formally defined within it through semantic annotations), publishers
                (using the advantages of new technologies as envisioned by the Semantic Publishing
                movement).</p>
            <p><em>Value:</em> RASH helps authors to focus on the
                organisation of their texts, supports them in the task
                of semantically enriching the content of articles, and leaves all the issues about 
                validation, visualisation, conversion, and semantic data extraction to the various
                tools developed within its Framework.</p>

        <section id="sec_introduction">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In the last months of 2014, several posts within technical mailing lists of the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lod/2014Nov/0003.html">Web</a>
                and <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lod/2014Oct/0058.html">Semantic Web</a> community have discussed an evergreen topic in scholarly
                communication, i.e., how could authors of research papers could submit their works in HTML
                rather than, say, PDF, MS Word or LaTeX. Besides the obvious justification of
                simplification and unification of data formats for drafting, submission and
                publication, an additional underlying rationale is that the adoption of HTML would
                ease the embedding of semantic annotations, thus improving research communications thanks to already existing W3C standards such
                as RDFa <a href="#rdfa"> </a>, Turtle <a href="#turtle"> </a> and JSON-LD <a href="#jsonld"> </a>. 
                This opens complex and exciting scenarios that the Semantic
                Publishing community has promised us in terms of increased discoverability,
                interactivity, openness and usability of the scientific works<a href="#force11"> </a>
                <a href="#shotton-sempub"> </a>.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, HTML is still primarily used as an output format only: the authors write
                their papers in LaTeX or MS Word and submit sources to the typesetters, who are
                responsible for producing the final version, that eventually will be published and read
                on the Web. Appropriate tools in the publishing toolchain are used to convert papers
                among multiple formats. </p>
            <p>The interest in <em>Web-first research papers</em> - that are natively designed,
                stored and transferred in HTML - is increasing. Just to cite a few research efforts:
                    <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org">Scholarly HTML</a> defines a set of
                descriptive rules for adopting a defined subset of HTML to describe the metadata and
                content of scholarly articles; <a href="http://dokie.li">Dokieli</a> is a Web
                application that allows authors to create HTML-based scholarly articles directly on
                the browser, adding annotations and many other sophisticated features.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach towards the same goal: providing authors with
                a subset of HTML for Web-first papers. The format is called RASH,
                    <em>Research Articles in Simplified HTML</em>, and consists of 32
                HTML elements only. This format is also accompanied by the <em>RASH Framework</em>,
                a set of specifications and tools for RASH documents <a href="#rash-release"> </a>.</p>

            <p>There are two key differences between RASH and other similar proposals. First of all,
                RASH adopts a <em>simplified pattern-based data model</em>. The number of markup
                elements to be used by authors was reduced down to the bare minimum, and the
                elements themselves were chosen in order to minimize the cognitive effort of authors
                when writing documents. Secondly, RASH does not come with a full authoring
                environment but is expected to be produced from MS Word, ODT and LaTeX sources. The
                basic idea is to allow authors to keep using the word processors on which they routinely write their papers and to provide them with multi-format converters. These converters are included in
                the RASH Framework, whose architecture is modular and extensible for handling new
                formats in the future.</p>
            <p>
                RASH is in fact intended to help authors in focussing on the
                organisation of their texts and supports them in the task
                of semantically enriching the content of articles, delegating all the issues about
                validation/presentation/conversion of RASH documents to the various tools developed
                within its Framework. This is a well-known principle in scientific publishing, even if not yet fully applied:
                    <em>clear separation of concerns</em>. The authors should focus on organising the
                content and structure only, and the format should not require authors to worry about
                how the content will be presented on screen and in print. The publishers will then take care
                of creating the final formatting to best render the content in the style of their
                publications, or authors could use self-publishing platforms as promoted by <a href="http://linkedresearch.org">Linked Research</a>. 
                
                
                Such a separation of concerns can be pushed much forward.
			Pettifer et al.<a href="#pettifer-sempub"> </a>
			explained well the difference between an article as <q>an instance of scholarly thought</q> and <q>a representation for consumption by human or machine</q>,
            and showed how multiple representations can be combined, integrated with external data, enhanced and interacted with in order to provide scholars with sophisticated tools 
            directly within their articles.
            </p>
            <p>Another critical requirement for any HTML-based language used
                for scientific writing is <em>good rendering and acceptance by the publishers</em>.
                Any new HTML-based format should be beneficial for publishers as well. Of course,
                publishers, conferences, and workshop organisers, would like to manage new formats in
                the same way as for the formats they already support, such as LaTeX. To this end, these formats should support tools for their conversion and for rendering the content in specific layouts, such as <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM ICPS</a>
                and <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">Springer
                    LNCS</a>. RASH adopts a <em>pragmatic approach</em> to this issue: while
                we are interested in a full-fledged native RASH authoring environment, we
                implemented a set of converters, in the RASH Framework, that are easily integrable
                (and were integrated) with existing publishing platforms.</p>

            <p>The goal of this paper is, in fact, to describe the outcomes of some experimentations
                on the use of RASH, so as to understand:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>if it can be adopted as HTML-based submission format in academic venues
                        (workshops, conferences, journals);</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>if it is easy to learn and use;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>if it can be used to add semantic annotations and what are the
                        most widely adopted vocabularies in RASH
                        papers;</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In <a href="#sec_related_works"> </a>
                we introduce some of the most relevant related works in the area, providing a
                functional comparison of the various works. In <a href="#sec_rationale"> </a> we
                introduce the rationale for the creation of a new Web-first format for scholarly
                publications, discussing the importance of <em>minimality</em>. In <a href="#sec_rash"> </a> and <a href="#sec_rash_framework"> </a> we introduce the
                theoretical background of RASH, and then provide an introduction to the language and
                the main tools included in its Framework. In <a href="#sec_evaluation"> </a> we present, as a case study, an analysis of the adoption of RASH at the <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2015/index.html">SAVE-SD 2015</a> and <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2016/index.html">SAVE-SD 2016</a> workshops.
                Finally, in <a href="#sec_conclusions"> </a> we conclude the paper by sketching out some

            <h1>Related works</h1>
            <p>The growing interest in the publication of Web-first research papers has resulted in
                the release of some interesting projects related to RASH. In the following
                subsections, we discuss all the most important contributions in this area by
                splitting them into two main categories: (i) HTML-based formats and (ii) WYSIWYG
                editors for HTML documents.</p>
            <p>Note that we do not discuss in detail some other efforts that have recently been done by
                means of non-HTML languages, even if they are equally relevant for the community. <a href="http://scholarlymarkdown.com/">ScholarlyMarkdown</a>
                <a href="#scholmd"> </a>, for instance, is a syntax to produce scholarly articles
                according to a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
                input. <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a> is a Web-based real-time
                collaborative editor for LaTeX documents.</p>

            <p>In <a href="#table_comparison"> </a> we briefly summarise the features and
                capabilities of the formats presented, in order to highlight the main differences
                between them.</p>

                <h1>HTML-based formats</h1>
                <p>One of the first documented contributions that proposed an HTML-based format
                    for scholarly articles was <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org">Scholarly
                        HTML</a>. It is not defined as a formal grammar, but as a set of
                    descriptive rules which allows one to specify just a reduced amount of HTML tags
                    for describing the metadata and content of a scholarly article. It is the main
                    intermediate format used in <a href="http://contentmine.org">ContentMine</a> for
                    describing the conversion of PDF content into HTML.</p>
                <p>Along the same lines, <a href="https://github.com/thomaspark/pubcss/">PubCSS</a>
                    is a project which aims at pushing the use of HTML+CSS for writing scholarly
                    articles. It does not define a formal grammar for the HTML element set to use.
                    Rather it provides some HTML templates according to four different CSS styles,
                    which mimic four LaTeX styles for Computer Science articles, i.e.
                    ACM SIG Proceedings, ACM SIGCHI Proceedings, ACM SIGCHI Extended Abstracts, and
                    IEEE Conference Proceedings.</p>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/">HTMLBooks</a> is an
                    O'Reilly's specification for creating HTML documents (books, in particular) by
                    using a subset of all the (X)HTML5 elements. This is one of the first public
                    works by a publisher for pushing HTML-like publications, even if the status of
                    its documentation (and, consequently, of its schema) is still <q>unofficial</q>.</p>
                <p>Another project, which shares the same name of one of the previous ones, <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io">Scholarly
                        HTML</a>, is a work by the <a href="http://science.ai">science.ai</a>
                    company that aims at providing a domain-specific data format based on open
                    standards (among which HTML5) for enabling <q>the interoperable exchange of
                        scholarly articles in a manner that is compatible with off-the-shelf
                        browsers</q>
                    <a href="#scholarlyhtml2"> </a>. While the format is not defined by any
                    particular formal grammar, it has a well-described documentation <a href="#scholarlyhtml2"> </a> that teaches how to produce scholarly documents
                    by using a quite large set of HTML tags, accompanied by <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> annotations for describing specific
                    structural roles of documents as well as basic metadata of the paper. The company also provides services that enable the conversion from Microsoft Word document into ScholarlyHTML format. </p>
                <p>One of the authors of the previous work is also the chair of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/scholarlyhtml/">W3C community group
                        called <q>Scholarly HTML</q></a> which aims at developing a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/scholarly-html">HTML vernacular</a> for the
                    creation of a Web-first format for scholarly articles. It involves several
                    people from all the aforementioned specifications (including RASH), and the
                    group work should result in the release of a community-proposed interchange HTML
                    format. As of August 10, 2016, the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/scholarly-html/">online documentation</a> is
                    mainly a fork of the Scholarly HTML specification proposed by science.ai
                    discussed above.</p>

                <h1>HTML-oriented WYSIWYG editors</h1>
                <p>One of the most important and recent proposals, which is compliant with the
                    principles introduced as part of the <em><a href="http://linkedresearch.org">Linked Research</a></em> project<a href="#fn11"> </a>
                    <a href="#linked-research">, </a> is <em><a href="http://dokie.li">dokieli</a></em> <a href="#capadisli-dokieli"></a>. Dokieli is a web application (still under development)
                    that allows the creation of HTML-based scholarly articles directly on the browser,
                    and implements several features among which are annotations (in RDF) and a notification
                    system. The application makes also available some
                    HTML templates and a series of widgets for navigating, visualising (in different
                    formats) and printing research documents easily by using common browsers.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.fiduswriter.org/">Fidus Writer</a> is another Web-based
                    application for creating HTML scholarly documents by means of a
                    wordprocessor-like interface. While the particular format used is not explicitly
                    specified, it allows the conversion of the HTML documents created within the
                    application in two different formats, i.e. EPUB and LaTeX (alongside with
                    HTML).</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.authorea.com">Authorea</a> is a Web service that allows users to write papers by means of a clear and effective interface. It enables the inclusion of the main components of scientific papers such as inline elements (emphasis, quotations, etc.), complex structures (figures, equations, etc.), and allows the use of Markdown and LaTeX for adding more sophisticated constructs. In addition, Authorea is able to export the document in four different formats (PDF, LaTeX, DOCX, and zipped archive with several HTML files) and according to a large number of stylesheets used in academic venues.</p>

        <section id="sec_rationale">
            <h1>Which <q>Web-first</q> format for research articles?</h1>
            <p>The term "Web-first" format indicates the possibility of using HTML as a primary
                format to write, store and transfer research articles, and not only to make these
                articles available on the Web. Some questions naturally arise in this context: shall
                we use the full HTML? If we impose a limited subset, which elements should we consider?
                Shall we demand specific rules for using the language? </p>
            <p>Some works, e.g. <a href="#linked-research"> </a>, suggest not to force any particular HTML structure
                for research papers. This choice would allow authors to use whatever HTML structure
                they want for writing papers and would reduce (even, eliminate) the fear for the
                    <em>template bottleneck</em>, i.e., the fact that users may not adopt a particular language if they are compelled to follow specific rules. On the other hand, leaving to the authors
                the freedom of using, potentially, the whole
                HTML specification may affect, in some way, the whole writing and publishing process
                of articles. The author could adopt any kinds of HTML
                <em>linearisations</em>, e.g.: using elements
                <code>div</code> instead of elements <code>section</code>, using elements
                <code>table</code> for their presentational behaviour (i.e. how they are rendered by browsers or other software readers)
                and not for presenting tabular data, and the like. This freedom could 
                result in two main kinds of issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><em>visualisation bottleneck</em> – it may affect the correct use of
                        existing, well-developed and pretty standard CSSs (e.g., Capadisli's CSSs
                        developed for <a href="http://dokieli.io">Dokieli</a>) for both screen and
                        print media, in having to write new codes for handling paper visualisation correctly;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>less focus on the research content</em> – the fact that a certain paper
                        is not visualised in a browser very well (or, worse, in a way that is not
                        the one the author expects) could bring the author to work on the
                        presentation of the text, rather than on focussing on the actual research
                        content of the text.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another point against the use of any HTML syntax for writing papers concerns the
                possibility of enabling an easy way for sharing the paper with others (e.g.,
                co-authors) who, potentially, may not use HTML in the same way. If all the
                co-authors of a paper are able to use the full HTML, they may not understand other
                users' specific use of some HTML tags — <q>why did they use the elements
                        <code>section</code> instead of <code>div</code>?</q>; <q>what is this
                    freaky use of elements <code>table</code>?</q>. Hence, the advantages of using a
                common HTML format is quite evident: only one syntax and only one possible
                semantics.</p>

            <p>There is a further issue worth mentioning. Having a shared, unambiguous and simple format
                would facilitate conversions from/into other complex ones (e.g., ODT <a href="#odt"> </a>, OOXML <a href="#ooxml"> </a>, DocBook <a href="#docbook"> </a>, JATS <a href="#jats"> </a>), thus enabling authors to use their own text editors or
                word-processors to modify the articles. The conversion is instead much more complex,
                error-prone and imprecise on the full HTML.</p>
            <p>To complicate an already complex scenario there is the <em>necessary</em> involvement of
                publishers. Allowing the authors to use their own HTML format could be counterproductive from a publisher's perspective, in particular when we speak about
                the possibility of adopting such HTML formats for regular conference/journal camera-ready submissions. From a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/forcnet/g4BNAOOMjMM">recent
                    discussion on the Force11 mailing list</a>, it emerges that publishers are
                willing to adopt HTML for submissions <em>if and only if</em> it is a clear
                community need. It means that they will include HTML formats in the publishing
                workflow only once a number of conference organisers decides to include HTML among 
                the accepted formats for paper submissions<a href="#fn6"> </a>. However, using one
                clear Web-first format, rather than a plethora of possible variations allowed by the
                full HTML schema, would certainly lighten the burden of publishers for including HTML within their publishing workflow. This inclusion could be additionally favoured by the availability of services (e.g.,
                editors, converters, enhancers, visualisers) for facilitating the use of such a Web-first
                format within the existing publishing environments.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, using a controlled subset of HTML is more appropriate for
                    <em>Semantic Publishing</em> applications <a href="#shotton-sempub"> </a><a href="#peroni-book"> </a>. The development of scripts and applications to
                extract, for instance, RDF statements directly from the markup structure of the text
                is a sort of nightmare if different authors use HTML in different manners. For
                instance, what happens when trying to extract the rhetorical organisation of a
                scientific paper according to the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco">Document
                    Component Ontology (DoCO)</a>
                <a href="#doco"> </a> from two HTML documents that use HTML tags in different ways?
                Is an HTML element <code>table</code> an actual table (containing tabular data)?
                Which are the tags identifying sections? These analyses are all easier within a controlled and unambiguous subset of HTML.</p>

        <section id="sec_rash">
            <h1>Writing scholarly articles in HTML with RASH</h1>
            <p>The subset of HTML we propose in RASH is strictly compliant to a <em>patterns
                    theory</em> we have developed over the past few years. 
           Patterns are widely accepted solutions to handle recurring problems. 
           Firstly introduced for architecture and engineering problems <a href="#alexander-pattern"> </a>, 
           they have been successfully deployed in computer science 
           and in particular in software engineering <a href="#gamma-pattern"> </a>.
           In this section, we briefly
           introduce our patterns for document engineering 
           and then we go into the details of RASH.</p>
            <section id="sec_patterns">
                <h1>Theoretical foundations: structural patterns</h1>
                <p>While we have plenty of tools and languages for creating new markup languages
                    (e.g. RelaxNG <a href="#relaxng"> </a> and XMLSchema <a href="#xmlschema"> </a>),
                    these usually do not provide any particular guideline for fostering the
                    development of robust and well-shaped document languages. In order to fill that
                    gap, in the last decade we have experimented with the use of a <em>theory of
                        structural patterns</em> for markup documents <a href="#patterns"> </a>, that has since been applied in several national and international
                    standards, among which <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legaldocml/">OASIS LegalDocumentML</a><a href="#fn7"> </a>, a legal document
                    standard for the specification of parliamentary, legislative and judicial
                    documents, and for their interchange between institutions in different
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The basic idea behind this theory is that each element of a markup language
                    should comply with one and only one structural pattern, depending on the fact
                    that the element:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>can or cannot contain text (<em>+t</em> in the first case,
                                <em>-t</em> otherwise);</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>can or cannot contain other elements (<em>+s</em> in the first case,
                                <em>-s</em> otherwise);</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>is contained by another element that can or cannot contain text
                                (<em>+T</em> in the first case, <em>-T</em> otherwise).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By combining all these possible values – i.e. <em>±t</em>, <em>±s</em>,
                    and <em>±T</em> – we basically obtain eight core structural patterns, namely
                    (accompanied by a plausible example within the HTML elements):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>inline [+t+s+T], e.g. the element <code>em</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>block [+t+s-T], e.g. the element <code>p</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>popup [-t+s+T], e.g. the element <code>aside</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>container [-t+s-T], e.g. the element
                            <code>section</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>atom [+t-s+T], e.g. the element <code>abbr</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>field [+t-s-T], e.g. the element <code>title</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>milestone [-t-s+T], e.g. the element <code>img</code>;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>meta [-t-s-T], e.g. the element <code>link</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instead of defining a large number of complex and diversified structures, the
                    idea is that a small number of structural patterns are sufficient to express
                    what most users need for defining the organisation of their documents. Therefore, the two main aspects related to such patterns
                    are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>orthogonality</em> – each pattern has a specific goal and fits a specific
                            context. It makes it possible to associate a single pattern to each of
                            the most common situations in document design. Conversely, for every
                            situation encountered in the creation of a new markup
                            language, the corresponding pattern is immediately selectable and
                            applicable;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>assemblability</em> – each pattern can be used only in some contexts within
                            other patterns. This strictness provides expressiveness and
                            non-ambiguity in the patterns. By limiting the possible choices,
                            patterns prevent the creation of uncontrolled and misleading content
                            structures.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Such patterns allow authors to create unambiguous, manageable and well-structured
                    markup languages and, consequently, documents, fostering increased reusability (e.g., inclusion, conversion, etc.) among different languages.
                    Also, thanks to the regularity they provide, it is possible to perform easily
                    complex operations on pattern-based documents even when knowing very little
                    about their vocabulary (automatic visualisation of document, inferences on the
                    document structure, etc.). In this way, designers can implement more reliable and
                    efficient tools, can make a hypothesis regarding the meanings of the document
                    fragments, can identify singularities and can study the global properties of a set of
                    documents, as described in <a href="#patterns-recognising"></a> <a href="#doco-recognising"></a>.</p>    
                <p>We applied these guidelines for the definition of RASH. We restricted HTML, which does not use the aforementioned patterns in a systematic way, allowing the creation of arbitrary and, sometimes, quite ambiguous structures by selecting a good subset of elements expressive enough to capture the typical components of a scholarly article while being also well-designed, easy to reuse and robust.

                <h1>RASH: Research Article in Simplified HTML</h1>
                <p>The <em>Research Articles in Simplified HTML</em> (<em>RASH</em>) format is a
                    markup language that restricts the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> elements to only <em>32 elements</em> for writing academic
                    research articles. It allows authors to use embedded RDF annotations. In addition, RASH strictly follows the Digital
                    Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 <a href="#dpub"> </a> for expressing structural semantics on various markup elements
                    used.</p>
                <p>All RASH documents begin as a simple HTML5 document<a href="#fn4"> </a> <a href="#html5"> </a>, by
                    specifying the generic HTML DOCTYPE followed by the document element
                        <code>html</code> with the usual namespace (
                        <q>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</q>) and with additional (and mandatory)
                    prefix declarations through the attribute <code>prefix</code><a href="#fn3"> </a>. The element <code>html</code> contains the element <code>head</code> for
                    defining metadata of the document according to the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCTERMS</a> and <a href="http://www.prismstandard.org/">PRISM</a> standards and the element
                        <code>body</code> for including the whole content of the document. The element <code>head</code> of a RASH document must include
                    some information about the paper, i.e., the paper title (element
                        <code>title</code>), at least one author, while other related information
                    (i.e., affiliations, keywords and categories included using the elements
                        <code>meta</code> and <code>link</code>) are optional. The element
                        <code>body</code> mainly contains textual elements (e.g., paragraphs,
                    emphases, links, and quotations) for describing the content of the paper, and
                    other structural elements (e.g., abstract, sections, references, and footnotes)
                    used to organise the paper in appropriate blocks and to present specific
                    complex structures (e.g., figures, formulas, and tables).</p>
                <p>In the following subsection, we provide a quick discussion about usage patterns in
                    RASH, and introduce the tools used for developing its grammar.</p>

                <section>
                    <h1>Development and patterns</h1>
                    <p>The development of RASH started from the whole HTML5
                        grammar, and proceeded by removing and restricting the particular use of
                        HTML elements, to make them expressive enough for representing the structures
                        of scholarly papers and to have the language totally compliant with the
                        theory on <em>structural patterns</em> for XML documents <a href="#patterns"> </a> introduced in <a href="#sec_patterns"> </a></p>
                    <p>The systematic use of these structural patterns is an
                        added value in all stages of the documents' lifecycle: they can be
                        guidelines for creating well-engineered documents and vocabularies, rules to
                        extract structural components from legacy documents, indicators to study to
                        what extent documents share design principles and community guidelines. All
                        these characteristics have allowed us to simplify, at least to some extent,
                        the handling of all the requirements introduced in <a href="#sec_introduction"> </a> and <a href="#sec_rationale"> </a> in RASH.
                            <a href="#table_patterns"> </a> shows what is the current pattern
                        assignment for each element in RASH.</p>

                        <figcaption>The use of structural patterns in RASH.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Notice that we do not use two patterns presented in <a href="#sec_patterns"> </a>, namely <em>atom</em> and <em>popup</em>. The
                        elements compliant with the former pattern are contained in discursive blocks (e.g. paragraphs) and contain only textual content with no additional elements. This is very infrequent
                        in scholarly writings since any element
                        used for emphases, links, and other in-sentence elements can always contain
                        additional elements (e.g. an emphasis can contain a link).</p>
                    <p>A different discourse can be done for the pattern <em>popup</em>, which is
                    	meant to represent complex substructures
                        that interrupt but do not break the main flow of the text, such as footnotes
                            <a href="#patterns"> </a>.
                        An element compliant to the <em>popup</em> pattern, while still not allowing directly text content inside
                        itself, is found in elements with a mixed  context
                            [<code>+t+s</code>]. In particular, in developing RASH, we
                        discussed which of the following two possible approaches for defining
                        footnotes was more adequate to our needs.</p>
                    <p>The first option was a <em>container</em>-based behaviour, also suggested by JATS <a href="#jats"> </a> by means of the element <code>fn-group</code> and not included in HTML specifications, that
                        allows the authors to specify footnotes (through the element <code>ft</code>) by
                        using a tag that is totally separated from the main text from which it is
                        referenced (usually through XML attributes), as shown in the following
                        excerpt:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;-- A paragraph referring to a footnote --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this paragraph there is an explicit reference to the 
    second footnote&lt;xref rid="n2"&gt;&lt;/xref&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;-- The group containing all the footnotes --&gt;
&lt;fn-group&gt;
    &lt;fn id="n1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph within a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/fn&gt;
    &lt;fn id="n2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph in another footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            All the footnotes are contained in a group, so as
            to collect them together.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/fn&gt;
    ...
&lt;/fn-group&gt;
                        </code></pre>
                    <p>The alternative was a <em>popup</em>-based behaviour, used by
                        default in LaTeX (through the marker <code>\footnote{}</code>) and even
                        possible in JATS (which is a very permissive language by design), where a
                        paragraph can be abruptly interrupted by one or more paragraphs specified in
                        a footnote, as shown in the following excerpt:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;-- A paragraph containing a footnote --&gt;

    In this paragraph the footnote &lt;fn id="n3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is
    what we call popup-based behaviour!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fn&gt; has been 
    defined directly within it.
&lt;/p&gt;

                    <p>We considered the latter approach a bit confusing, since it actually
                        decreases the readability of the HTML source where footnotes are needed. We thus 
                        decided to adopt a solution similar to the JATS <code>fn-group</code>
                        element, extending the HTML5 <code>section</code> element with <code>@role</code> set to <code>doc-endnotes</code> and <code>doc-endnote</code>:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;-- A paragraph referring to a footnote --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this paragraph there is an explicit reference to the 
    second footnote&lt;a href="#fn2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;-- The group containing all the footnotes --&gt;
&lt;section role="doc-endnotes"&gt;
    &lt;section role="doc-endnote" id="fn1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is the text of a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;section role="doc-endnote" id="fn2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is the text of another footnote.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <h1>Grammar and peculiarities</h1>
                    <p>The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/essepuntato/rash/7ef4c2f2ea63575fb32f17e826d60333543eda67/grammar/rash.rng">formal grammar of RASH</a> (current version: 0.6.1) has been developed by
                        means of RelaxNG <a href="#relaxng"> </a>, which is a simple, easy to learn,
                        and powerful schema language for XML. The grammar has been logically
                        organised in four distinct logical blocks of syntactic rules, defining
                        respectively elements, attributes, content models<a href="#fn9"> </a> for the
                        elements and their related attribute lists, as summarised in the following

                    <p>Starting from the latest versions of the language, there has been a clear shift towards an extended use of HTML5 semantic elements, despite the fact they are
                        not backwards compatible with their more generic alternatives in HTML4 <a href="#html4"></a>.
                        In particular, the elements <code>section</code>, <code>figure</code>, and
                            <code>figcaption</code> have been adopted so as to clearly refer to
                        paper sections and boxes with tables, figures, listings and formulas,
                        accompanied by a particular caption.</p>
                    <p>While this choice has fostered the readability of the source, the use of
                        these HTML5 elements was not enough to provide proper semantics and
                        accessibility to the RASH source. Thus, in order to improve the user
                        experience in terms of accessibility of such HTML-based papers, RASH reuses
                        some items from the W3C Accessible Rich Internet Applications 1.1 <a href="#aria"> </a>, and also exploits several roles introduced in the
                        Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0 <a href="#dpub"> </a>, which allows the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpub-aria/2016Feb/0032.html"><q>digital publishers to apply the structural semantics they need to drive the authoring process while getting free accessibility</q></a>. The use of such semantics is implemented by means of the
                        attribute <code>@role</code><a href="#fn10"> </a>, that can be used on
                        certain RASH elements, e.g. sections, and it is very useful for specifying a
                        clear structural semantics where it is not formally defined. For instance,
                        all the references are organised in a list within a special section defined
                        by using the element <code>section</code> with the attribute
                            <code>@role</code> set to <q>doc-bibliography</q>. This special section
                        contains one list with a bibliographic reference for each list item (i.e.,
                        the element <code>li</code> accompanied by the attribute <code>@id</code>
                        for referencing to it within the text and the attribute <code>@role</code>
                        set to <q>doc-biblioentry</q>), as shown in the following excerpt:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;section role="doc-bibliography"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li id="Per2014" role="doc-biblioentry"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Write here the reference entry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p> Formulas require special consideration, since there are different ways to
                        implement them. The standard specification for
                        representing mathematics on the Web is MathML <a href="#mathml"> </a>. Even
                        if MathML is the best accessible way for writing mathematical formulas, the
                        organisation of the elements for defining even a quite simple formula is
                        quite verbose and this is a reasonable obstacle to its direct adoption, as
                        shown in the following excerpt for describing the formula <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>π</mi><mo/><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
    &lt;mi&gt;π&lt;/mi&gt;
    &lt;mo&gt;⁢&lt;!-- &amp;InvisibleTimes; --&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;
    &lt;msup&gt;
        &lt;mi&gt;r&lt;/mi&gt;
        &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;
    &lt;/msup&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>To help the creator of RASH documents in dealing with formulas, RASH
                        adds two other ways for writing formulas in addition to MathML. The first
                        one is to use an image (element <code>img</code>), which is a very simple
                        way to include maths in a paper. On the other hand, it is not accessible at
                        all since the various elements of the formula are not marked-up properly so
                        as to distinguish them. Another option is to use LaTeX, which is one
                        of the most common ways to write formulas in many scientific papers. Both
                        options are specifiable in RASH by using either the element
                            <code>img</code> or the element <code>span</code> respectively,
                        accompanied by the attribute <code>@role</code> set to <q>math</q>, as shown
                        in the following excerpt:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;-- Specifying a formula through the element 'img' --&gt;
&lt;img role="math" src="formula.png" alt="r^2" /&gt;

&lt;-- Specifying a formula in LaTeX through the element 'span' --&gt;
&lt;span role="math"&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/span&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>The rendering of any LaTeX formula and the multi-browser support for MathML
                        is implemented by using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>,
                        which is a Javascript display engine for mathematics that works in most modern
                        browsers. Of course, it is necessary to explicitly import MathJax in the element
                            <code>head</code> if any rendering of formulas is actually needed, as
                        shown in the following:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;!-- MathJax for multi-browser support of LaTeX formulas and MathML --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>RASH has been developed in order to allow anyone to add <span property="cito:credits" resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</span> annotations <a href="#rdfa"> </a> to any element of the
                        document. For instance, this paragraph contains the following RDF statement
                        (in Turtle <a href="#turtle"> </a>):</p>
                    <pre><code>
@prefix cito: &lt;http://purl.org/spar/cito/&gt; .
&lt;&gt; cito:credits &lt;http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/&gt; .</code></pre>
                    <p>That was implemented by using specific RDFa attributes
                            (<code>@property</code> and <code>@resource</code>, in this case) within
                        the paragraph content, while the prefixes were defined in the element
                            <code>html</code>, as shown in the following excerpt:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;html prefix="cito: http://purl.org/spar/cito/"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;p&gt;
        RASH has been developed in order to allow anyone to add 
        &lt;span 
            property="cito:credits" 
            resource="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/"&gt;RDFa&lt;/span&gt; 
        annotations to any element of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    ...
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
                    <p>In addition to RDFa, RASH makes available another way to inject RDF
                        statements <a href="#rdf"> </a> to the document, by means of an element
                            <code>script</code> (within the element <code>head</code>):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>with the attribute <code>type</code> set to <q>text/turtle</q> for
                                adding plain Turtle content <a href="#turtle"> </a>;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>with the attribute <code>type</code> set to
                                    <q>application/ld+json</q> for adding plain JSON-LD content <a href="#jsonld"> </a>;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>with the attribute <code>type</code> set to
                                    <q>application/rdf+xml</q> for adding plain RDF/XML content <a href="#rdfxml"> </a>.</p>

                    <p>It is worth noticing that RASH does not require any particular vocabulary for introducing RDF statements, except three properties from <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> for defining author's metadata (see <a href="https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/documentation/index.html#metadata">Section 2 of the RASH documentation</a> for additional details). For instance, in this document (in particular, in its <a href="https://w3id.org/people/essepuntato/papers/rash-peerj2016.html">RASH version</a>) we mainly use CiTO <a href="#peroni-cito"> </a> and
                        other SPAR Ontologies <a href="#peroni-spar"> </a> for creating citation

            <h1>The RASH Framework</h1>
            <p>One of the issues we had to face, and in general anyone has to face when proposing a
                new markup language, was to provide tools for writing papers in RASH. It is
                undeniable that: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>not all the potential authors are able (or willing) to write scholarly
                        articles in HTML, even within the Web community;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>not all the potential authors are able (or willing) to manually add additional
                        semantic annotations, even within the Semantic Web community.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The authorial activity of writing an article by using RASH, but also any other new
                Web-first format, <em>must</em> be supported by appropriate interfaces and tools to reach a
                broad adoption.</p>
            <p>A possible solution was to implement a native HTML authoring
                environment, so that authors did not have to deal directly with the new language. However, this solution would have forced all co-authors to use to the same tool and introduced a variety of technical difficulties,
                since it is not easy to create and support a user friendly and flexible work environment.
                We believe that a more liberal approach, that
                allows each author to keep using her/his preferred tools, even off-line, is more
                practical. </p>
            <p>This is the idea behind the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash">RASH Framework</a> <a href="#rash-release"> </a>: a set of
                specifications and writing/conversion/extraction tools for writing articles in
                    <em>RASH</em>. In this section, we give a brief description of all the tools we
                have developed in the framework. All the software components are distributed under

                    are fully compatible with the HTML5 specifications <a href="#html5"> </a>.</p>
                <p>In order to check whether a document is compliant with RASH, we <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/blob/master/tools/rash-check.sh">developed a
                    script</a> to enable RASH users to check their documents simultaneously both against
                    the specific requirements in the RASH RelaxNG grammar and 
                    also against the HTML specification through <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">W3C Nu HTML
                        Checker</a>. This will hopefully help RASH users to timely detect and fix any mistakes in their documents. This script also checks datatype microsyntaxes.</p>
                <p>In addition to the aforementioned script, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/rash-validator">Python application</a> that enables one to validate RASH documents against the RASH grammar. This application makes also available a Web interface for visualising all the validation issues retrieved in RASH documents.</p>

                <h1>Visualising RASH documents</h1>
                <p>The visualization of a RASH document is rendered
                    by the browser by means of appropriate <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html">CSS3</a> stylesheets <a href="#css3"> </a> and Javascript developed for this purpose.</p>
                <p>RASH adopts external libraries, such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, in order to provide the current
                    visualisation and include additional tools for the user. For instance,
                    the footbar with statistics about the paper (i.e., number of words, figures,
                    tables and formulas) and a menu to change the actual layout of the page<a href="#fn5"> </a>, the automatic reordering of footnotes and references, the
                    visualisation of the metadata of the paper, etc.</p>
                <p>Note that this kind of automatic rendering of paper items, such as references
                    to a bibliographic entry or a figure, reduce the cognitive effort of an author
                    when writing a RASH paper. For instance, a piece of text referencing a table,
                    e.g. <q>as shown in <a href="#table_patterns"> </a></q> is created without caring
                    about the particular text to specify for that reference (<q><a href="#table_patterns"> </a></q> in the example), since RASH prescribes
                    to specify just an empty link to the object one wants to refer to, as shown in
                    the following excerpt:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;... as shown in &lt;a href="#table_patterns"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>For these objects, the Javascript scripts decide
                    which is the most suitable text to put there according to the type of the item
                    referenced.</p>

                <h1>Converting RASH into LaTeX styles</h1>
                <p>We spent some effort in preparing XSLT 2.0 documents <a href="#xslt2"> </a>
                    for converting RASH documents into different LaTeX styles, such as <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM
                        ICPS</a> and <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">Springer
                        LNCS</a>, among the others. We believe this is essential to foster the use of RASH
                    within international events and to easily publish
                    RASH documents in the official LaTeX format currently required by the organisation
                    committee of such events. Obviously, the full adoption of RASH or any other Web-first format, would make these stylesheets not necessary but, currently, they are fundamental for the adoption of the overall approach.</p>

            <section id="sec_converting_odt">
                <h1>Producing RASH from ODT and DOCX</h1>
                <p>We also developed two XSLT 2.0 documents to perform
                    conversion from <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/blob/master/xslt/from-odt.xsl">Apache OpenOffice documents</a> and <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/blob/master/xslt/from-docx.xsl">Microsoft Word documents</a> into RASH documents. The RASH documentation provides a detailed description of how to use <a href="https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/documentation/rash-in-odt.odt">Apache OpenOffice</a> and <a href="https://rawgit.com/essepuntato/rash/master/documentation/rash-in-docx.docx">Microsoft Word</a> 
                for writing scientific documents that can be easily converted to the RASH format. The 
                standard features of these two editors (e.g. styles, document properties, etc.), elements 
                (e.g. lists, pictures, captions, footnotes, hyperlinks, etc.) 
                and facilities (e.g. mathematical editor, cross-reference editor, etc.) can be used to
                produce fully compliant RASH documents. A web-based service, for converting 
                documents online (presented in <a href="#sec_rocs"> </a>) and two Java applications for <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/odt2rash">ODT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tree/master/tools/docx2rash">DOCX</a> documents (that can be downloaded and used offline on the local machine) were developed to facilitate the conversion process of Apache OpenOffice and Microsoft Word 
                documents into the RASH format.</p>
                <p>In the past few years, as sort of alpha-testing, we have used these conversion
                    approaches with many internal projects in the Digital and Semantic Publishing
                    Laboratory of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the
                    University of Bologna. Moreover, also our co-authors and collaborators from 
                    different disciplines (e.g. business and management, humanities, medicine, etc.) 
                    have successfully used this approach for producing their documents, giving us a chance to have fruitful feedback, comments, and suggestions. In particular, 
                    we have been able to convert with discrete success several ODT and DOCX files of research papers, Ph.D. theses, documentations, and project proposals and deliverables.</p>

            <section id="sec_rocs">
                <h1>ROCS</h1>
                <p>We created an online conversion tool called <a href="http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs"><em>ROCS</em> (<em>RASH Online
                            Conversion Service</em>)</a>
                    <a href="#diiorio-rocs"> </a> for supporting authors in writing RASH documents
                    and preparing submissions that could be easily processed by journals, workshops,
                    and conferences. ROCS integrates the tools introduced in the previous
                    sections.</p>
                <p>The abstract architecture of the tool is shown in <a href="#fig_rocs"> </a>. ROCS
                    allows converting either an ODT document or a DOCX document, written according to specific guidelines,
                    into RASH and, then, into LaTeX according to the following layouts: Springer LNCS, ACM
                    IPCS, ACM Journal Large, PeerJ. Such guidelines, introduced in <a href="#sec_converting_odt"> </a>, are very simple and use only the basic features
                    available in Apache OpenOffice Writer and in Microsoft Word, without any external tool or plug-in.</p>
                <figure id="fig_rocs">
                    <p>
                        <img src="img/rocs-peerj.png" alt="The architecture of ROCS."/>

                    <figcaption>The architecture of ROCS.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>ROCS allows users to upload four kinds of file, i.e., an ODT document, a DOCX document, an HTML
                    file compliant with RASH, and a ZIP archive which contains an HTML file
                    compliant with RASH and related files (i.e., CSSs, javascript files, fonts,
                    images). It returns a ZIP archive containing the original document plus all its
                    converted versions, i.e., RASH, if an ODT/DOCX file was given, and the LaTeX file. </p>
                <p>The main advantage of having the paper both in RASH and in LaTeX is that it is
                    fairly easy for RASH to be adopted by workshops, conferences or journals. Since 
                    the program committee, the reviewers, and the editors have also access to a
                    LaTeX or a PDF version of the paper, the RASH file is an addition that does not
                    preclude any current workflows. Of course, the hope is that the inherent
                    advantages of an HTML-based format such as RASH will eventually persuade
                    stakeholders to adopt the HTML version whenever it is possible, keeping the
                    alternatives as fall-back options.</p>

                <h1>Enriching RASH documents with structural semantics</h1>
                <p>Another development of the RASH Framework concerns the automatic enrichment
                    of RASH documents with RDFa annotations defining the actual structure of such
                    documents in terms of the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio">FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBIO)</a> and the 
                    <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco">Document Component Ontology (DoCO)</a>
                    <a href="#doco"> </a>. More in detail, we developed a Java application called <em>SPAR Xtractor
                        suite</em><a href="#fn12"> </a>. 
                        SPAR Xtractor is designed as a one-click tool
                        able to add automatically structural semantics to a RASH document. SPAR Xtractor takes a RASH document as input and returns
                    a new RASH document where all its markup elements have been annotated with their
                    actual structural semantics by means of RDFa. The tool associates a set of FaBIO or DoCO types with specific
                    HTML elements. The set of HTML elements and their associations with FaBIO or DoCO types can be customised according to specific
                    needs of expressivity. The default association provided by the current release of SPAR Xtractor is the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
	                    <li><p>the root <code>html</code> element is mapped to an individual of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Expression"><code>fabio:Expression</code></a>. 
	                    The class <code>fabio:Expression</code> identifies the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is realised;</p></li>
                        <li><p>the <code>body</code> element is mapped to an individual of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco/BodyMatter"><code>doco:BodyMatter</code></a>. 
	                    The class <code>doco:BodyMatter</code> is the central principle part of a document, it contains the real document content, and it is subdivided hierarchically by means of sections;</p></li>
	                    <li><p><code>p</code> elements are represented as individuals of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco/Paragraph"><code>doco:Paragraph</code></a>, 
	                    i.e. self-contained units of discourse that deal with a particular point or idea;</p></li>
	                    <li><p><code>figure</code> elements containing the element <code>img</code> within a paragraph are represented as individuals
	                    of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco/FigureBox"><code>doco:FigureBox</code></a>, which is a space within a document that contains a figure and its caption;</p></li>
	                    <li><p><code>section</code> elements are mapped to individuals of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco/Section"><code>doco:Section</code></a>, which represents
	                    a logical division of the text. Sections can be organised according to a variable level of nested sub-sections. Accordingly, SPAR Xtractor
	                    reflects this structural behaviour by representing the containment relation by means of the object property <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/2008/12/pattern#contains"><code>po:contains</code></a><a href="#fn13"> </a>.
	                    For example, a certain <code>section</code> element with a nested <code>section</code> element produces two individuals of the class
	                    <code>doco:Section</code> (e.g. <code>:section_outer a doco:Section</code> and <code>:div_inner a section:Section</code>) related by the property <code>po:contains</code> 
	                    (e.g. <code>div_outer po:contains :div_inner</code>).</p></li>
	                </ul>


				<p>In addition to these semantic annotations, which come from the actual structure of a document, the tool is also able to automatically 
                detect sentences and annotate them as individuals of the class <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco/Sentence"><code>doco:Sentence</code></a>.
                A <code>doco:Sentence</code> 
                denotes an expression in natural language forming a single grammatical unit.
                For the sentence detection task, SPAR Xtractor relies on the sentence detection module of the <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/">Apache OpenNLP project</a>, which provides a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.
                By default, SPAR Xtractor is released to support English only. However, it is possible to extend it with new languages by adding their corresponding 
                models for Apache OpenNLP, most of which are available with <a href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/">an open licence</a>.
                </p>
                <p>We remark that the object property <code>po:contains</code>
                is used for representing any kind of containment relation among the structural components that 
                SPAR Xtractor deals with. Hence, the usage of such a property is not limited to the individuals of the class <code>doco:Section</code> only. In fact, 
                the property <code>po:contains</code> can be used, for example, for expressing the containment relation between a <code>doco:BodyMatter</code> and
                a <code>doco:Section</code> or between a <code>doco:Section</code> and 
                a <code>doco:Sentence</code>.
                For example, let us consider the following code snippets that provide a sample HTML document.</p>
                <pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;
  ...                
  &lt;body&gt;
    ...
    &lt;section&gt;&lt;h1&gt;A section&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is a sentence. This is another sentence of this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
      ...
      &lt;section&gt;&lt;h1&gt;A sub-section&lt;/h1&gt; ... &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;/section&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre>
                <p>The HTML document in the snippet above is enriched by SPAR Xtractor resulting in the document
                reported in the snippet below.</p>

                <p>A recent development of RASH is the <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/tools/RAJE"><em>RASH Javascript Editor</em> (RAJE)</a> <a href="#spinaci-raje"> </a>, a multiplatform <em>What You See Is What You Get</em> (WYSIWYG) word processor for writing scholarly articles in HTML, according to the RASH format.

                <p>RAJE guarantees to its users the benefits of a word processor combined with those given by an HTML-based format, i.e. interactiveness, accessibility and easiness to be processed by machine. In addition, RAJE uses the <a href="https://api.github.com/">GitHub API</a> so as to allow authors to store their articles online, to keep track of changes by means of the GitHub services, and to share the articles with others.</p>

            <h1>RASH and SAVE-SD: an evaluation</h1>
            <p>The true validation for RASH as a format for research papers rests on its <strong>adoption by authors and workshops </strong> and its <strong>integration
                    in the publishing process</strong>. For this reason, RASH was first released in
                conjunction with the <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2015/index.html">Semantics,
                    Analytics, Visualisation: Enhancing Scholarly Data (SAVE-SD 2015) workshop</a>,
                co-located with WWW 2015. It was subsequently <a href="https://github.com/essepuntato/rash/#rash-papers-accepted-in-scholarly-venues">adopted by a number of workshops and conferences</a>. In this section, we will
                present an evaluation of RASH based on the analysis of questionnaires completed by authors and reviewers of SAVE-SD 2015 and
                    <a href="http://cs.unibo.it/save-sd/2016/index.html">SAVE-SD 2016</a> workshops and a study on RDF annotations in the relevant papers.</p>
<p>
                The users were asked to fill a questionnaire which included a section about their background, a SUS questionnaire and six
                open questions about their experience with RASH. We will first introduce the two
                workshops and then discuss and compare the evaluation results. Finally, we will present an analysis of the most frequent vocabularies and entities in RASH papers. The completed questionnaires and the outcomes of the analysis are available at <a href="#rash-eval"> </a>, while the RDF annotations considered in the study are embedded in the RASH papers available in the SAVE-SD 2015 and SAVE-SD 2016 websites. We used the online version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/">RDFa 1.1 Distiller</a> for extracting the RDF annotations from the RASH papers.</p>
            <p> It is worth noting that in 2015 there were no converters in the RASH
                framework, and ROCS was introduced immediately before SAVE-SD 2016. Thus, in both
                years authors wrote RASH papers with plain text editors or XML editors, apart from
                one author that used ROCS in 2016. In general, the authors
                appreciated RASH and the tools in the RASH framework, even if the editing
                environment and the converters are still limited.</p>

                <h1>SAVE-SD 2015 and 2016</h1>
                <p>SAVE-SD 2015 was organized by some of the authors of this paper with the aim of bringing together publishers,
                    companies, and researchers in order to bridge the gap between the
                    theoretical/academic and practical/industrial aspects in regard to scholarly
                    data. It was thus a multifaceted workshop which drew researchers from
                    a number of heterogeneous fields, such as Document and Knowledge Engineering,
                    Semantic Web, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication,
                    Bibliometrics and Human-Computer Interaction. Since many of the interested
                    researchers were keen on experimenting with novel technologies regarding semantic
                    publishing, it was a natural choice for the debut of RASH. For this reason,
                    SAVE-SD 2015 allowed authors to submit papers using either RASH or PDF,
                    explicitly encouraging authors to test the new format. To this end, the
                    organisers introduced a special award for the best submission in RASH, according
                    to the quality of the markup, the number of RDF statements defined in RDFa, and
                    the number of RDF links to LOD datasets. The possibility of submitting in RASH
                    was also advertised on social media (e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/savesdworkshop">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/savesdworkshop">Facebook</a>) and during
                    various international events (e.g., <a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/digital-libraries-2014">DL 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/conferences/EKAW14/home.html">EKAW 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2015">FORCE 2015</a>).</p>
                <p>The initiative had a substantial success: the workshop received 6 out of 23
                    submissions in RASH and after the review process an additional author chose to
                    prepare the camera-ready paper in RASH. Out of these 7 final submissions, 3 were
                    research papers, 1 was a position paper, and 3 posters/demo. These papers were
                    submitted by 16 authors from Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, United
                    Kingdom, Ireland, and the USA.</p>
                <p>At the time of the workshop submission deadline, there were no public tools
                    available for converting other formats into RASH. However, the authors were able
                    to self-learn it by simply referring to the documentation page, confirming that
                    computer scientists have no particular problem in handling it directly. The
                    conversion of the RASH submissions into the ACM format requested by the Sheridan
                    publisher (responsible for the publications of all WWW proceedings) was handled
                    by the organisers through a semi-automatic process. In particular, they used the
                    XLST files introduced in <a href="#sec_converting_latex"> </a> and had to fix
                    only a few layout misalignments.</p>
                <p>Six authors and four reviewers involved in SAVE-SD 2015 participated in our
                    evaluation.</p>

                <p>SAVE-SD 2016 had the same
                    characteristics and goals of the predecessor. In order to give authors full
                    freedom, the organizer decided to accept not only RASH, but any kind of
                    HTML-based format. Since it was not possible to handle the conversion of all
                    possible HTML-based format to the publisher layout, the authors of alternative
                    formats were asked to prepare a PDF of the camera-ready version according to the
                    publisher needs.</p>
                <p>SAVE-SD 2016 received 6 out of 16 submissions in RASH from 14 authors from Italy,
                    Sweden, Greece, Germany, Belgium, and the USA. In total, 5 out of the 14
                    accepted papers were in RASH, including 2 full papers, 2 demos, and 1 position
                    paper. Even if no author chose to submit in other HTML-based formats, this
                    possibility will be kept open in future editions. Differently from the previous
                    edition, the proceedings were published as a dedicated LNCS volume. The
                    conversions of RASH papers to the PDF documents in Springer LNCS layout was
                    automatically handled by ROCS.</p>
                <p>As in the previous workshop, we evaluated RASH by conducting the same study (with
                    the same exact questions) on ten people. Seven authors of RASH papers and three reviewers
                    participated in the survey.</p>

            <section>
                <h1>User background</h1>
                <p>It is useful to first assess the background of RASH pioneer users in term of their knowledge of relevant technologies and software. For this reason, the first section of the survey included a number of statements about the user expertize (e.g., "I have extensive experience in writing academic papers with LaTeX ") and allowed five response options, from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree". <a href="#tab_background"> </a> shows the percentage of users who claimed to be familiar with a range of technologies (by selecting "Agree" or "Strongly Agree").

                </figure>
                <p>In 2015, the authors were mainly from the Semantic Web community and therefore
                    familiar with technologies such as RDFa and Turtle. Most of them knew how to
                    correctly annotate an HTML file and understood the advantages of including
                    semantic relationships in the paper. They also commonly used LaTeX rather than
                    Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Writer. This suggests that they were acquainted
                    with WYSIWYG editors and had experience with complex formats. A qualitative
                    analysis of the survey answers confirms this intuition; for example, an author
                    remarked: <q>I am used to writing papers in LaTeX so I do not want to bother
                        with formatting and in that sense RASH is similar</q>.</p>
                <p>In 2016 the situation changed and only 57% of the users were familiar with
                    semantic technologies. In addition, even if most of them knew how to use LaTex,
                    the majority of them had experience also with Microsoft Word. It seems thus that
                    RASH started to interest also less technical users with different research
                    backgrounds.</p>

                <h1>User survey</h1>
                <p>We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of RASH by means of six open questions. We
                    summarize here the answers of both authors and reviewers for the 2015 and 2016
                    workshops. The reviewers answered only questions 2, 3, 4 and 5. Note that the
                    questions were exactly the same in both editions and none of the users 
                    partecipated in both the surveys.</p>

                            <p>Four authors answered that the main reason was to try it out, mostly
                                because they <q>supported the idea of publishing academic papers as
                                    HTML</q> and were convinced that <q>PDF should be replaced</q>.

                                setting up the bibliography, were still cumbersome. They added that
                                the development of tools that could solve these issues and hide the
                                technical details from the common users would be very important for a
                                broader adoption. The reviewers remarked that their experience was
                                very similar to reviewing a paper in PDF format and did not present
                                any particular challenge (e.g., <q>did not have many features that

                                captions should be improved. Half of them also pointed out that the
                                manual insertion of semantic annotations was cumbersome and a large
                                amount of RDFa <q>introduces a bit of confusion in the paper</q>. An
                                author observed that using the word count as a limit in the RASH
                                venues rather than the number of pages introduces the issue of
                                possibly exceeding the editor limits. Most reviewers did not report
                                any problem in using RASH for assessing a paper. However, one of
                                them noted that it still lacked a menu for easily navigating the
                                different sections, as PDF files instead support.</p>

                                need for a WYSIWYG editor, since <q>writing in html is not so

                                produced by Microsoft Word could not be processed by ROCS. As in

                                PDF papers. One of them claimed to actually prefer RASH since it

                        using the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire<a href="#sus"> </a>. The scores are acceptable, though not very high, especially if we
                        consider that all authors but one edited RASH files directly with
                        text/XML editors. Users perceived even a 'vanilla RASH' as acceptable,
                        though they need more sophisticated converters as remarked in the open
                        questions of the survey.</p>
                    <p>RASH yielded a mean score of 62.7±11.9, slightly lower than the average SUS
                        score (68). However, SUS scores varied dramatically according to the person's 
                        background. <a href="#fig_evaluation"> </a> shows the results of different
                        categories of expertize<a href="#fn15"> </a> in HTML, LateX, and Semantic Web Technologies
                        (SWT), which appear correlated with the average SUS scores (respectively
                            <em>r</em> = 0.78, 0.97, 0.99). Users with a strong expertize in LaTeX
                        and SWT yielded significantly better SUS scores than the other authors, while authors with HTML
                        expertize yielded only slightly better scores. For this reason, authors from
                        2015, who as previously discussed had a higher expertize in these categories
                        obtained an average SUS score of 69.6±11.9, while the authors from 2016
                        yielded 57.1±9.7. However, the difference is not statistically significant
                        because the two samples are small and the test power is low.</p>

                <h1>Analysis of RDF annotations in RASH documents</h1>
                <p>To complete the previous analysis, we also studied the nature of the semantic annotations in
                    RASH papers. We focused on a sample of 1751 annotations obtained from 11 papers published in SAVE-SD 2015 and 2016.
                    The number of statements in a single paper was found to range from 24 to 903,
                    yielding a median value of 46 (25th percentile 34, 75th percentile 175). We
                    extracted all the RDF statements by running the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/">W3C RDFa 1.1 Distiller service</a> on
                    each article. We then considered only the statements that used http-based
                    entities as predicates, or their objects if used for typing resources. The data
                    are organised in several CSV files and have been obtained by running a Python
                    script we developed for gathering the data used in this evaluation. The script and all the aforementioned  data have been made available at <a href="#rash-eval"> </a>.</p>
                <p>The first goal of the study was to determine the prevalent vocabularies and how
                    much they were used in the average paper. The left panel of <a href="#fig1"> </a>
                    shows the common vocabularies. Schema.org and PRISM are actually enforced by
                    RASH: the first is used for standard metadata such as emails, affiliations and
                    organization names and the second for keywords. In addition, a quantity of XHTML

                    of the evaluation. The other common vocabularies are Dublin Core, which appears
                    in 82% of the papers, FOAF (27%) and the SPAR ontologies <a href="#peroni-spar"> </a>, such as FABIO (36%) and CITO (27%) <a href="#peroni-cito"> </a>. The right
                    panel of <a href="#fig1"> </a> illustrates the average number of statement for
                    each of these vocabularies. Dublin Core characterizes the highest number of
                    annotation (9.4), followed by FOAF (7.4) and FABIO (6.4).</p>

                </figure>
                <p>We also performed a more fine-grained analysis considering the amount of entities
                    of these vocabularies within the various RDF statements. The goal was to
                    understand the percentage of contribution that the various entities provide (on
                    average) to the statements of the document analysed. As expected, the entities
                    that contribute to about 60% of the statements are either those that are obliged
                    by RASH (<code>prism:keyword</code> 6.9%, <code>schema:affiliation</code> 5.7%,
                        <code>schema:name</code> 5.3%, and <code>schema:email</code> 4.7%) or those
                    automatically extracted by processing the DPUB roles included, mandatorily, in
                    the documents (<code>xhtml:role</code> 38%). Excluding these, the following top
                    ten entities, shown in <a href="#fig2"> </a>, cover about 20% of the
                    statements.</p>
                <p>Among these entities, there are three classes describing three diverse but
                    interlinked kinds of objects, i.e. people (<code>foaf:Person</code>) authoring a
                    research work (<code>fabio:ResearchPaper</code>) and the sentences
                        (<code>doco:Sentence</code>) therein contained. The other seven entities are
                    three object properties – two of them (<code>pav:authoredBy</code> and
                        <code>pattern:contains</code>) provide the links between the three
                    aforementioned classes, while the other, i.e., <code>cito:cites</code>,
                    describes citation links between papers – and four data properties – used for
                    providing additional metadata about the entities (<code>dcterms:title</code>,
                        <code>dcterms:bibliographicCitation</code>, <code>foaf:name</code>) and for
                    describing bunches of textual content of the sentences
                        (<code>c4o:hasContent</code>).</p>

                <h1>Discussion</h1>
                <p>The evaluation study confirmed that RASH is ready to be be  be adopted in workshops,
                    conferences, and journals and can be quickly learnt by researchers who are 
                    already familiar with HTML. However, it also highlighted some issues in the adoption of
                    HTML formats, especially by less technically savvy users.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the 2016 survey showed that RASH is being tried also by users
                    unfamiliar with semantic web technology. While the expansion of the user base
                    represents a positive development, it also yields a number of challenges. The
                    mass of authors accustomed to WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word or
                    OpenOffice Writer, tend to have difficulties with HTML editors. In addition,
                    since research papers are often written by multiple authors, it is usually
                    simpler to use the most well-known solutions. For these reasons, we need to
                    offer the authors who currently cannot or do not want to change their workflow the tools
                    for converting their favourite format to RASH and annotate the resulting paper.
                    While ODT was a first step in this direction, it is imperative to be also able
                    to process DOCX and LaTeX. A second important issue is that authors who are not
                    expert in semantic technologies can find it hard to correctly annotate their
                    papers. Hence, we also need to use and/or develop simple tools for helping authors in this
                    phase – such as the <a href="http://osde.openlinksw.com/">OpenLink Structured Data Editor</a>. The introduction of these solutions will be critical for motivating users
                    to adopt HTML-based approaches and for creating a robust framework that can be
                    used by expert and common users alike.</p>
                <p>As far as the analysis of the RDF annotations in RASH documents is concerned, the
                    outcomes highlighted that the users decided to adopt a few
                    well-known standard vocabularies, rather than using a multiplicity of different
                    solutions. The most used vocabularies other than Schema.org and PRISM (used by default by RASH), are Dublin Core, FOAF, and the SPAR ontologies.
                    However, the outcomes of our evaluation generally show a quite low number of
                    statements specified by the authors. This behaviour could derive from the lack
                    of appropriate support for the annotation of RASH papers with RDF data. In
                    addition, this low number seems not to be related to the research community the
                    authors work in. For instance, several of the papers written by Semantic Web
                    experts do not include any RDF statements other than those enforced by RASH.</p>

        <section id="sec_conclusions">
            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>In this paper we have introduced <em>RASH</em>, a markup language defined as a subset
                of HTML for writing scientific articles, and the <em>RASH Framework</em>, a set of
                specifications and tools for writing articles in RASH. In particular, we
                have discussed the rationale behind the development of RASH, and we have presented
                the language and the validation/visualisation/conversion/extraction tools developed so far. </p>
            <p>The goal of the paper was also to investigate the applicability and the
                potentialities of RASH, though the evaluation of its
                adoption in two SAVE-SD workshops. To the best of our
                knowledge, this is the first empirical evaluation on the adoption of HTML-based
                languages for writing scientific papers. The experiments proved that RASH can be
                successfully used for workshops and conferences, with a good acceptance by the
                authors and a smooth integration in the existing publishing process. </p>
            <p>As immediate future developments, we plan to develop tools for automating the process of semantic
				enrichment of RASH documents. For instance, we are currently working on the automatic identification of section rhetorics and citation functions so as to describe them according to two SPAR Ontologies <a href="#peroni-spar"> </a>, i.e. the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/doco">Document Component
				    Ontology (DoCO)</a> and the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito">Citation Typing Ontology
                    (CiTO)</a> respectively. We are also developing a Web tool for validating RASH document so as to spot possible syntactic errors more easily. 
            </p>
			<p>We intend to further develop the RASH framework. In first instance, we are working on more sophisticated
                authoring tools and converters. For instance, we are currently developing additional XSLT documents in order to convert RASH documents into several different LaTeX
                formats for scholarly communications – such as IEEE conference proceedings and IOS Press – as well as into EPUB for easing its
                (offline) portability in mobile devices, which is something that would guarantee a better archival and accessibility of the whole document including its figures, CSS files, and JS scripts.</p>            
            <p>We are also experimenting techniques for automatically
                generating accessible graphs from data contained in a referenced CSV file. Some results of this experimentation are already discussed in <a href="#rash-csv"> </a>.</p>

                        <code>contrib</code> – and in this case it identifies the name of a
                    particular contributor of the article in consideration – or in the element
                        <code>mixed-citation</code> – where it can be used to say that a certain
                    string is actually representing a name within a bibliographic entry <a href="#peroni-jats"> </a>.</p>
